# Facebook_Location
Downloaded Facebook Location information from personal Facebook Account. The information contains town name, latitude and longitude coordiantes, and timestamp. This project is a template for people who want to download their Facebook location data as a JSON file. I used Jupyter Notebook to write the code.
